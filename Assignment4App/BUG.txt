Currently in the CardInterface.kt file the useCard function for the interface takes
both the card number and the authorization token and reflects that when it is 
actually called in UseCard.kt. However, the api (@PUT("/api/use/{card_number}")) that the 
function calls on the backend to use a card takes only the card number. As a result, this
allows a malicious user to use a someonelse's card since the backend never authorizes
whether it was actually them that used the card or not and only ever takes the card_number
as input. Therefore, this bug can be resolved by just having the backend use api take
the authorization token as well and just verify on the backend whether this token was
used to buy the gift card or not before allowing it to be used.
