Questions:

The two types of intents are explicit and implicit for
which explicit is the more secure type since it specifies
the android component to be used while the other doesn't.
For instance, lines 69 to 73 of SecondFragment.kt is an
implicit intent while lines 68 to 70 of ThirdFragment.kt
is an explicit intent. As a result, the intent in
ThirdFragment.kt is more secure one.

Fix:

NOTE: CONFIRM THAT MY FIX IS GOOD

This therefore means that the intent in SecondFragment.kt
is not correct. I then fixed this intent by modifying
SecondFragment.kt to specify what it actually wants to
perform the activity since before the fix the app would
go to a 200 ok webpage when registering. Now after the fix
it instead brings the user to the giftcard page so that they
can buy a gift card immediatly after registering.
